#  Airtight Container for Mars Rover Soil Collection

## Overview
This project presents an **airtight soil collection container** designed for Mars rovers. The container ensures **dust-tight sealing and secure sample storage** to prevent contamination and maintain sample integrity under Martian conditions. It is designed with **mechanical seals and locking mechanisms** for efficient sample collection and preservation.

Developed in **SolidWorks**, the project includes **CAD files, a detailed report with justifications, and an animation** demonstrating the sealing mechanism.

## Features
- **Airtight sealing** to prevent contamination from Martian dust.
- **Locking mechanism** for secure sample storage during rover movement.
- **Material Selection:**
  - **Body:** Aluminum alloy for strength and lightweight.
  - **Seal:** Silicone-based gasket for flexibility and airtight performance.
- **Complete Design Package:**
  - ✅ **CAD files (.sldprt, .stepAP214)**
  - ✅ **Engineering report (PDF) with justifications and references**
  - ✅ **Animation demonstrating sealing and locking mechanisms**
- **All components available for purchase online in BD**
